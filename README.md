## Problem Statement
How can we create awareness of carbon individuals emmit in their daily lives?

## Problem Solution
The carbon emission tacker tracks and gives the result of carbon individuals emmit in their daily lives in respect to their daily activities

## Challenges faced
* Find a good API that could help in acheiving the solution
* Connecting the selected option to its API
* Whenever the user type into the input field and the value is fetch, it displays it as a null value.

## Challenges Solved
* We were able to use tracker for carbon footprint API, we discovered that in rapidapi.com
* We were able to connect the selected option to its API

We had fun building the project even though we started at the last hour and this was because members in the team were preparing for their examss and a team member already started his exam but still we sticked together and was able to build something. Thanks to Bunmi's words of encouragement that "no matter what stage you are in your project, it will only be judged if you submit it". 

We hope to improve the project, fix the neccessary bug, refactor the code and add more features like tracking how any times you tracked your activities, suggestions on what to do if the carbon emmitted is high etc probably after our exams. LOL
