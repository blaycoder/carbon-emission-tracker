## Problem Statement
The excessive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide, is what leads to the worldwide problem of climate change. The primary sources of carbon emissions are human activities like manufacturing, transportation, and the production of energy. People frequently underestimate how much carbon they actually emit from their everyday activities. Motivating people to act and reduce their carbon footprint is difficult due to this dearth of awareness.

Therefore, a system that allows people to precisely track their daily carbon emissions must be created. Individuals can make wise decisions about their daily activities that increase carbon emissions by being given this knowledge. Additionally, the system ought to offer recommendations for actions that produce less carbon dioxide or actions that directly lower carbon dioxide emissions, like planting trees.

By gathering information on individual behavior and offering tailored recommendations to lower carbon emissions, the initiative hopes to get better over time. The project can encourage people to adopt more environmentally sustainable lifestyles and support the battle against climate change by raising awareness and offering solutions to reduce carbon emissions.

## Problem Solution
With the help of a carbon footprint tracker system, which we developed, we can encourage people to live more environmentally responsible lives by making them conscious of their daily carbon emissions.

The system uses the Tracker for Carbon Footprint API, a tool that lets people precisely track their daily carbon emissions. People can clearly grasp how much carbon they emit from their everyday activities by connecting to this API with your solution.

Our solution calculates the amount of carbon emissions produced by everyday actions such as transportation, electricity use, and food consumption that users can input. To monitor their progress in lowering their carbon footprint, users can also examine their daily, weekly, or monthly total carbon emissions.

Our solution also has features like tailored suggestions on how to cut carbon emissions, like walking instead of driving, using energy-efficient equipment, and following a plant-based diet, to make the system more interactive and user-friendly. Users can also get advice on how to reduce their carbon emissions, like planting trees or giving to green energy initiatives.

In general, the goal of our solution is to inform and motivate people to reduce their carbon footprints and participate in the battle against climate change. Your answer has the potential to significantly influence the promotion of sustainability and a cleaner environment with future upgrades and added features.

## Challenges faced
* Find a good API that could help in acheiving the solution
* Connecting the selected option to its API
* Whenever the user type into the input field and the value is fetch, it displays it as a null value.

## Solved Challenges 
* We were able to use tracker for carbon footprint API, we discovered that in rapidapi.com
* We were able to connect the selected option to its API

We had fun building the project even though we started at the last hour and this was because members in the team were preparing for their examss and a team member already started his exam but still we sticked together and was able to build something. Thanks to Bunmi's words of encouragement that "no matter what stage you are in your project, it will only be judged if you submit it". 

We hope to improve the project, fix the neccessary bug, refactor the code and add more features like tracking how any times you tracked your activities, suggestions on what to do if the carbon emmitted is high etc probably after our exams. LOL
