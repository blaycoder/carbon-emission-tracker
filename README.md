We had fun building the project even though we started at the last hour and this was because everyone in the team were preparing for their exam and also a team member already 
started his exam but still we stick together and was able to do some thing. Thanks to Bunmi's words of encouragement.

We hope to improve the project, fix the neccessary bug and refactor the code.
